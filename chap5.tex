\chapter{CameraCL Android Application}

In CloudCamera, every request is sent to the cloud server. The cloud server keeps a dictionary linking each region to its newest photo.  Codewise, CloudCamera only has one file: CameraCloud.java that is analogous to DiplomaCameraâ€™s StatusActivity.java, but instead of sending UDP packets, CloudCamera sends HTTP post requests.
