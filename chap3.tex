\chapter{User Interface and Functionality of both Camera Apps}

The goal of the experiment is for users to share photos among themselves using their smart phones.  The smart phones can take new photos and request the latest photos taken by other phones. But unlike traditional photo sharing apps where each phone functions individually, our experiment assigns the phones into different regions based on their GPS locations and a region’s phones collectively save their photos.  This implies: a) a new photo is saved on its phone’s region, not the phone itself and b) a phone can only request the newest photo of a region, not of another individual phone. 
 
In our experiment, six square consecutive regions (0 to 5) about 30 meters wide were created along a stretch of busy road.  Ideally, there is no limit to the number of regions as long as a phone can only belong to one region at any time. The size of the region should be as big as possible, but still small enough that phones from any points in the region are within WIFI ranges from each other. The users walked around and pressed buttons on the apps to take new photos or request photos from different regions. With two apps on two different phones, the users synchronized the button presses so that sequences of events for the two app types are similar.

The two different apps are: DiplomaCamera and CloudCamera. Even though their UI are identical, DiplomaCamera handles the pictures using DIPLOMA while CloudCamera is the control of the experiment, handling all requests with the cloud.
