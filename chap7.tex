\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

We discussed a photo app, CameraDP, that uses a distributed ad-hoc network abstraction to carry out user's requests and compared its success rate and latency times to identical app, CameraCL, that relies only on the 3G or 4G cellular network. In general the CameraDP app had much lower latencies than the CameraCL app but the success rates were not favorable when used outdoors.

The promising results of the indoors experiment shed light on how much a distributed ad-hoc app can improve the latency on all the phones without much change in success rates. Even though our outdoor experiments also showed better latency, the success rate suffered due to the current state of ad-hoc Wifi on phones. If one day the Wifi ranges on the smart phones are increased, the the strength of Wifi is increased, and smart phones become ubiquitous, then it is very logical for phones to rely on each other, relieving the traffic on the cellular networks.
