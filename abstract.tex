We present a distributed photo-sharing Android application, CameraDP, that primarily relies on ad-hoc Wifi. The app runs on top of the novel DIstributed Programming Layer Over Mobile Agents (DIPLOMA) programming abstraction. DIPLOMA provides a consistent shared memory over a large distributed system of Android phones. The success rate and latency of photo upload and download on CameraDP were compared to the numbers generated from CameraCL, a 3G or 4G-only version of the same user interface as CameraDP. Under near-ideal Wifi conditions, a 10-phone CameraDP system yields a 2.6x improvement in latency over a 10 CameraCL phones running on 4G while and a 16x improvement over CameraCL running on 3G. The methods and results of this research suggests that distributed ad-hoc Wifi network apps may outperform cellular-network-only apps with improvements in Wifi technology.
