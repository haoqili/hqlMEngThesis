We present a distributed photo-sharing Android application, CameraDP, that uses ad-hoc Wifi connections in addition to the common 3G or 4G cellular network connections. The app utilizes the novel DIstributed Programming Layer Over Mobile Agents (DIPLOMA) programming layer to provide a consistent shared memory over a large distributed system of android phones. The success rate and latency of photo saves and photo gets on CameraDP were compared to the numbers generated from CameraCL, a 3G or 4G-only version of the same user interface as CameraDP. Under near-ideal Wifi conditions and only a 1.4\% sacrifice in success rate, a 10-phone CameraDP system yielded a 2.6x improvement over a 10 CameraCL phones running on 4G, and the CameraDP system yielded a 16x improvement over CameraCL running on 3G. The methods and results of this research suggest that this new way of designing phone apps using a distributed Wifi network may be very useful when Wifi becomes more robust and smart phone Wifi ranges increase.
