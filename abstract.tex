We present a distributed photo-sharing Android application, CameraDP, that relies on ad-hoc wireless over WiFi. The app utilizes the novel DIstributed Programming Layer Over Mobile Agents (DIPLOMA) programming layer to provide a consistent shared memory over a large distributed system of android phones. The success rate and latency of photo saves and photo gets on CameraDP were compared to the numbers generated from CameraCL, a WiFi-only version of the same user interface as CameraDP. Under near-ideal WiFi conditions with only a 1.4\% sacrifice in success rate, a 10-phone CameraDP system yielded a 2.6x improvement over a 10 CameraCL phones running on 4G, and the CameraDP system yielded a 16x improvement over CameraCL running on 3G. The ideas and methods of this research could be beneficial in the future if WiFi becomes more robust and smart phone WiFi ranges increase.
