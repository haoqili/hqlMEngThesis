We present a distributed photo-sharing Android application, CameraDP, that relies on ad-hoc Wifi over the common 3G or 4G cellular network. The app utilizes the novel DIstributed Programming Layer Over Mobile Agents (DIPLOMA) programming abstraction to provide a consistent shared memory over a large distributed system of android phones. The success rate and latency of photo saves and photo gets on CameraDP were compared to the numbers generated from CameraCL, a 3G or 4G-only version of the same user interface as CameraDP. Under near-ideal Wifi conditions and only a 1.4\% sacrifice in success rate, a 10-phone CameraDP system yielded a 2.6x improvement over a 10 CameraCL phones running on 4G, and the CameraDP system yielded a 16x improvement over CameraCL running on 3G. The methods and results of this research suggests that distributed ad-hoc Wifi network apps may outperform cellular-network-only apps when Wifi becomes more robust and smart phone Wifi ranges increase.
